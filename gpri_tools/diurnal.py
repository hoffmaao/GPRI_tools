"""Diurnal signals: harmonic analysis, and telling ice from atmosphere.

BakerBend1/20170803 is 723 acquisitions on a 2-minute cadence spanning 24.18
hours — one full diurnal cycle, sampled 723 times.  That is not an incidental
property of the dataset, it is the experiment: the target is the sub-daily
velocity and uplift variation driven by water pressure in the subglacial
drainage system, as the hydrological system reorganises through a melt day.

What a diurnal signal looks like
--------------------------------
Melt-driven input peaks in the afternoon.  Where the drainage system cannot
carry it, water pressure rises, the glacier partly separates from its bed, and
the surface both **lifts** and **speeds up**, relaxing overnight as the system
drains.  In LOS displacement that is a roughly sinusoidal term at 24 hours
riding on the secular flow rate, and its *phase* — the hour of peak — is the
diagnostic quantity, because it says how long the bed takes to respond to
surface melt.  :func:`fit_harmonics` estimates amplitude and phase per pixel by
weighted least squares, which handles the 2-minute sampling and the one
6-minute gap without special pleading.

The problem: the atmosphere is diurnal too
------------------------------------------
This is the whole methodological difficulty, and it is worth being blunt about.
Air temperature and humidity on a mountain flank cycle with a 24-hour period.
A residual refractivity error therefore appears in the time series **at exactly
the period being looked for, and roughly in phase with it** — melt and warming
peak together.  From :mod:`gpri_tools.refractivity`, 1 % of relative humidity is 0.8
fringes across the swath; the diurnal humidity swing is tens of percent.  The
atmospheric diurnal is, before correction, one to two orders of magnitude
larger than the glaciological one.

So a diurnal signal in the data is not evidence of subglacial hydrology.  Three
tests here, and a claim should survive all three:

1. :func:`range_dependence` — **the sharp one**.  Residual refractivity puts a
   phase ramp that is *linear in slant range*.  Ice motion has no reason to
   correlate with distance from a tripod.  If diurnal amplitude grows linearly
   with range, it is atmosphere.  This is a strong discriminator and it costs
   nothing.
2. :func:`atmospheric_coherence` — regress the per-pixel diurnal against the
   independently estimated per-epoch refractivity series
   (:func:`gpri_tools.refractivity.invert_refractivity`).  What is left after
   projecting that out is what can be defended.
3. :func:`stable_ground_null` — run the same fit on bedrock, which is not
   moving.  Any diurnal amplitude recovered there is the error floor, and no
   signal on ice below it means anything.

Reference the series first
--------------------------
Before any of that: an interferogram fixes phase only up to an additive
constant, so integrating a network accumulates one arbitrary offset per pair
into a scene-wide drift.  On a mountain flank that drift is diurnal, because
the atmosphere is, and it appears on ice and bedrock alike at the same phase.
Run :func:`gpri_tools.timeseries.reference_to_stable` before fitting, and hold out
reference pixels from the null test — testing on the pixels used to reference
is circular, since they were forced to zero by construction.  Skipping this
step produces a large, clean, entirely spurious diurnal signal; it is the
first thing to check when one appears.

The geometry limits what can be claimed
---------------------------------------
A tripod radar looks nearly horizontally: at BakerBend1 the beam elevation is
10 degrees, so LOS sensitivity to **vertical** motion is ``sin(10 deg) = 0.17``
while sensitivity to horizontal motion along the look direction is
``cos(10 deg) = 0.98``.  Uplift is suppressed by a factor of six relative to
speed-up, and one line of sight cannot separate them at all.
:func:`vertical_sensitivity` and :func:`decompose_los` make that explicit
rather than letting a LOS time series be read as uplift.

def secular_slope(times, y, period=DIURNAL, tolerance=None):
    """Slope of the secular part of ``y`` when its periodic part has any shape.

    A signal periodic in ``period`` contributes nothing to the difference
    between an epoch and the one a period later, so on a record longer than
    one cycle the same-hour differences are secular motion and noise alone,
    whatever the waveform — a night-time trough with a sharp morning step as
    much as a sinusoid.  A least-squares line, by contrast, absorbs part of
    any periodic component that is not symmetric about the record's middle
    (a sine over exactly one day correlates with a line at 0.78), so the
    "trend anomaly" it leaves is the waveform with a tilt taken out of it.

    ``y`` is ``(n_epochs, ...)``; ``times`` in days.  Every epoch that has a
    partner within ``tolerance`` days of one period later (default: half
    the median cadence) is paired; the slope is the median over pairs of
    their difference over their separation, per pixel, in ``y``'s units per
    day.  Returns ``(slope, n_pairs)``.  A record a few minutes short of a
    cycle can be admitted with ``tolerance=(1 - MIN_CYCLES) * period``, the
    same allowance the harmonic fits make: a partner ``d`` short of a period
    leaves ``d`` times the waveform's slope in the difference, which for a
    minutes-short record is well under the noise of the estimate.

    The sharpest test available, and the cheapest.  A residual refractivity
    error puts phase that is **linear in slant range**, so its diurnal
    signature grows linearly with distance from the radar.  Ice motion has no
    reason whatever to correlate with distance from a tripod parked on a
    moraine.  A significant positive slope means the diurnal is atmospheric.

    Parameters
    ----------
    amplitude : 2-D array
        Diurnal amplitude per pixel, metres.
    slant_range : 1-D array
        Slant range per range sample, metres — broadcast across azimuth.
    mask : bool array, optional
        Where to trust the amplitude (coherence, stable ground).

    Returns
    -------
    dict with ``slope`` (metres of amplitude per metre of range),
    ``intercept``, ``correlation``, ``n``, and ``verdict`` — a plain-language
    reading of the correlation.

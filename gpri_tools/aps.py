"""Network-consistent atmospheric correction: per-epoch screens plus turbulence.

Why per-pair screens are not enough
-----------------------------------
:func:`gpri_tools.atmosphere.fit_screen` estimates each interferogram's screen
independently.  Three things are wrong with stopping there, and the full-day
BakerBend1 run exposed all of them:

1. **The fits do not close.**  The screen of pair ``(i, j)`` is physically
   ``S_j - S_i`` — a difference of two per-epoch atmospheres — but independent
   fits are under no obligation to satisfy that, and their inconsistency is
   pure error injected into the time series.
2. **The noise accumulates.**  On a daisy chain the network inversion is a
   cumulative sum, so per-pair estimation noise integrates into a random walk.
   That walk was most of the 99.4 mm common mode found on the 20170803 day.
3. **Each fit sees one pair's worth of data.**  Epoch ``k`` appears in every
   pair that touches it; fitting per-pair throws that redundancy away.

Two corrections, for two different errors
----------------------------------------
:func:`invert_screens` treats the fitted per-pair screen *coefficients* as
network observations — exactly the quantities
:func:`gpri_tools.timeseries.invert_network` was built to invert — and solves for one
coefficient vector **per epoch**.  Screen coefficients are linear in the phase,
so this is exact, and the reconstructed pair screens ``e_j - e_i`` close by
construction.  Its real value is on networks with redundancy (``i -> i+2``
pairs and beyond), where the joint solve averages the per-pair noise down.
Be honest about its limit on a pure daisy chain: the system is square there,
so consistency alone changes nothing, and the temporal-smoothness penalty was
*measured* (synthetic 40-epoch chains) to help by only ~3 % at its best setting
and to hurt beyond it — because the error that matters is the low-frequency
random-walk drift of the integrated series, which a curvature penalty cannot
see.

:func:`epoch_screen_correction` is what actually kills the drift.  It works in
the **displacement domain**, after the network is integrated: at each epoch the
accumulated atmospheric error is, on stable ground, directly visible — bedrock
is not moving, so whatever spatial structure the series has there *is* the
error.  Fitting the screen model to each epoch's displacement over stable
ground and subtracting it everywhere generalises
:func:`gpri_tools.timeseries.reference_to_stable` from a constant to the full model:
the constant term is the common mode that function removes, and the range term
is the accumulated ramp drift it cannot.  No wrapping issues arise, because
displacement is already integrated.

What the parametric model can never catch
-----------------------------------------
A low-order polynomial in range and azimuth describes the *mixed, homogeneous*
part of the refractivity change.  The rest — moist convection rolling up the
flank, a cloud edge crossing the fan — is **turbulent**: spatially smooth on
scales of hundreds of metres, but not polynomial.  After the 20170803 day was
corrected with linear screens and referenced to bedrock, 41 % of the remaining
time-series variance was still explained by the refractivity series; that
residual is this term.

:func:`turbulence_screen` estimates it non-parametrically: the wrapped residual
phase *on stable ground* is smoothed by normalised convolution and read off as
a screen for the whole scene.  Working on the complex phasor means no
unwrapping; weighting by the stable mask means ice motion cannot leak into the
estimate — the screen over ice is interpolated from the rock around it, never
from the ice itself.  Where there is no stable ground within reach of the
kernel, the screen is zero and the phase is left alone, with the
``quality`` map saying so.

One correction that is *not* here, and why
------------------------------------------
A stratified (height-dependent) term, standard in spaceborne InSAR, is
**unidentifiable for a GPRI without a DEM**: every pixel shares the same
antenna elevation angle, so beam height is exactly ``alt + r sin(elev)`` —
perfectly linear in slant range and therefore absorbed, indistinguishably,
by the uniform-mixing ramp the matched filter already estimates.  Separating
them needs per-pixel terrain height, and no DEM accompanies the data.

    The drift killer.  After network integration, each epoch's accumulated
    atmospheric error is written plainly on stable ground — bedrock is not
    moving, so any spatial structure the displacement has there is error.
    This fits the screen model to every epoch's displacement over the masked
    pixels (one shared factorisation, so it is one ``lstsq`` for the whole
    series) and subtracts the evaluated screen from the whole scene.

    With ``model="constant"`` this *is*
    :func:`gpri_tools.timeseries.reference_to_stable` (with a weighted-mean rather
    than a median).  ``"linear"`` additionally removes the accumulated
    range-ramp drift — the spurious range-linear displacement that per-pair
    ramp noise integrates into and that spatial referencing cannot touch.

    Parameters
    ----------
    displacement : array (n_epochs, na, nr)
        LOS displacement, metres.
    mask : bool array (na, nr)
        Stable ground defining the fit.  As with referencing: hold pixels out
        of this mask if you intend to test the result on stable ground,
        or the test is circular.
    slant_range : (nr,) array
    azimuth : (na,) array, optional — required by models with azimuth terms.
    model : str or term sequence, from :data:`gpri_tools.atmosphere.MODELS`.
    weights : array (na, nr), optional
        Quality inside the mask (mean coherence is the natural choice).

    covariates : mapping of name -> array, optional
        Extra per-pixel predictors, each the shape of one epoch's image, fitted
        alongside the ``model`` terms and centred on their mean over the mask.

        The one that matters for a ground-based radar is **target height**.
        The built-in terms are functions of range and azimuth only, so a screen
        made of them can express how delay grows along the beam but not how it
        depends on how far the beam has climbed — and a stratified atmosphere
        depends on exactly that.  Where stable ground and the target of
        interest sit at the same ranges but different heights, a height
        covariate is the difference between removing the stratification and
        extrapolating a range ramp over it.

    Returns
    -------
    corrected : array, same shape
    coeffs : array (n_epochs, n_terms)
        Per-epoch fitted coefficients, in metres, for the centred predictors:

        given.  Feed the ``"r"`` column to :func:`displacement_ramp_to_delta_n`

    the screen over moving ice is interpolated from the rock around it — ice

    Run this **after** the parametric screens, when the residual on stable
    ground is small; wrapped arithmetic is then safe because averaging phasors

        is 0 — no correction — rather than an extrapolation from nothing.
    min_coherence : float
        Minimum magnitude of the averaged phasor.  If the stable pixels inside
        the kernel disagree with each other the mean phasor shrinks toward
        zero and its angle is noise; those places also get screen 0.  Only
        meaningful for wrapped input.
    wrapped : bool
        True (default) treats the input as wrapped phase and averages the

        averages the values directly — right for already-integrated
